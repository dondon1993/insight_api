Present in the collection are objects made on American soil from the early colonial period, reflecting the settlers&#x27; keen desire to reproduce as faithfully as possible the material world they had left behind in England, Holland, and other homelands. Styles adhered closely to overseas developments, though regional schools of cabinetmaking did emerge rather swiftly in Boston, Newport, New York, Philadelphia, Williamsburg, and Charleston. Over the next two centuries, assimilating trends and techniques from across the Atlantic was the major preoccupation of American designers and craftsmen. The department&#x27;s holdings reflect this ongoing dialogue, as well as the many truly original voices in American decorative arts.  The Metropolitan&#x27;s collection of American stained glass is perhaps the most comprehensive anywhere and features the innovative work of Louis Comfort Tiffany. Also noteworthy is the rest of the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century glass collection, including objects designed and produced by Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company; early furniture up to about 1820; Baroque-style silver of about 1700; presentation and exposition silver objects of the later nineteenth century; and nineteenth-century ceramics."}, {"name": "American Paintings and Sculpture", "link": "https://www.nyc.com/events/american_paintings_and_sculpture.1038962/", "description": "The collection of American paintings and sculpture at the Metropolitan Museum is one of the finest and most comprehensive in the world. More than one thousand paintings, six hundred sculptures, and 2,600 drawings - exceeding four thousand works in total by approximately nine hundred different artists- constitute an encyclopedic survey of fine art in America, from the late colonial period in the eighteenth century through the early twentieth century. The collection has been assembled over more than a century, beginning almost immediately after the Museum&#x27;s founding. (American paintings, sculpture, and drawings by artists born after 1878 are in the Department of Nineteenth-Century, Modern, and Contemporary Art, and all photographs in the Department of Photographs.)  Extraordinary in quality and exhaustive in scope, the department&#x27;s collection of paintings has impressive concentrations of portraits, landscapes, and narrative scenes, as well as notable works by America&#x27;s foremost painters, including John Singleton Copley, George Caleb Bingham, Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, John Singer Sargent, and John Sloan. The sculpture collection is equally distinguished and is especially strong in Neoclassical and Beaux-Arts works.  Please note that the galleries for American Paintings and Sculpture will reopen in late 2011, following a major renovation.

The works come from ancient Mesopotamia, Iran, Syria, Anatolia, and other lands in the region that extends from the Black and Caspian Seas in the north to the southwestern Arabian peninsula, and from western Turkey on the Mediterranean Sea to the Indus River Valley in modern-day Pakistan and India. Societies throughout the ancient Near East maintained commercial and cultural contacts across great distances, although the routes, trade goods, and artistic styles and motifs that were exchanged varied in different periods.  Strengths of the department&#x27;s collection, in formation for more than a century, include Sumerian sculptures; Anatolian ivories; Iranian bronzes; metalwork from Bronze Age Bactria in modern-day Afghanistan and Turkmenistan; and magnificent silver and gold vessels from the Achaemenid, Parthian, and Sasanian eras in Iran. These objects are joined by an extraordinary group of Assyrian stone reliefs depicting scenes of warfare and ritual and by enormous guardian figures, all from the Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II (883&#x2013;859 B.C.) at Nimrud, as well as by fine ivory carvings, many of which originally served as furniture ornaments at that site.

Arguably the preeminent institution of its kind in the world, the matrix of The Costume Institute collection was the Museum of Costume Art, an independent entity formed in 1937. Led by Neighborhood Playhouse founder Irene Lewisohn, the Museum of Costume Art benefited from gifts from Irene Lewisohn and her sister Alice Lewisohn Crowley, as well as from theatrical designers Aline Bernstein and Lee Simonson, among many others. In 1946, with the financial support of the fashion industry, the Museum of Costume Art merged with The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Costume Institute became a department in its own right in 1959. The legendary fashion arbiter Diana Vreeland, who served as special consultant from 1972 until her death in 1989, created a spectacular suite of costume exhibitions, including &#x201C;The World of Balenciaga&#x201D; (1973), &#x201C;Hollywood Design&#x201D; (1974), &#x201C;The Glory of Russian Costume&#x201D; (1976), and &#x201C;Vanity Fair&#x201D; (1977), galvanizing audiences and setting the international standard for the opulent exhibition of costume, chiefly based on loan items.  Today, The Costume Institute&#x27;s five thousand square feet of gallery space, refurbished in 1992, house two special exhibitions a year based on The Costume Institute&#x27;s peerless collection. These exhibitions have achieved the defining stature of the earlier Vreeland exhibitions by developing a critical discourse of fashion.  No other institution in the world has as ambitious a suite of exhibitions on fashion as The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Between exhibitions, The Costume Institute offers a docent-led tour, as well as &#x201C;The Art of Dress,&#x201D; a Family Guide that discusses fashion history within the context of the Museum&#x2019;s vast permanent collection of paintings, sculpture, decorative arts, armor, and textiles."}, {"name": "Drawings and Prints", "link": "https://www.nyc.com/events/drawings_and_prints.1038969/", "description": "The Metropolitan Museum owns approximately fifteen thousand drawings and 1.5 million prints.

While many of these objects were originally intended for decoration of a mosque or for use during worship, domestic and luxury objects in the collection reveal the mutual influence of artistic practice in the sacred and secular realms. In particular, the traditions of calligraphy, vegetal ornament (the arabesque), and geometric patterning are strongly expressed in most pieces on view.  To dispel a common misconception: Islam&#x27;s supposed prohibition against figural art is confined to the religious sphere.

Ranging from ancient Paleo-Indian points to contemporary fine arts, the collections include works of aesthetic, religious, and historical significance as well as articles produced for everyday use. Current holdings include all major culture areas of the Western Hemisphere, representing virtually all tribes in the United States, most of those of Canada, and a significant number of cultures from Middle and South America and the Caribbean. Approximately 68 percent of the object collections originate in the United States, with 3.5 percent from Canada, 10 percent from Mexico and Central America; 11 percent from South America; and 6 percent from the Caribbean. Overall, 55 percent of the collection is archaeological, 43 percent ethnographic, and 2 percent modern and contemporary arts. (These figures are based on catalog numbers, not number of items, where single catalog numbers encompassing dozens of sherds or projectile points would skew percentages toward archaeology.)  In terms of collections&#x2019; growth, NMAI continues to focus actively on modern and contemporary arts, relying on donations for the expansion of earlier ethnographic collections. Given the 1970 passage of UNESCO regulations controlling antiquities exports from Latin America, and North American Indian peoples&#x2019; continuing ambivalence about archaeology, there is little expectation for substantial growth of the archaeological collections. And although NMAI&#x2019;s enabling legislation encompasses Hawai&#x2019;i, the museum does not accept or collect Native Hawaiian material.

Over the past century, its collection has continued to grow through generous donations, bequests, and occasional purchases.  The Museum&#x2019;s collection takes center stage in the new permanent exhibition, Collections Central.  Objects in the gallery change frequently to expose visitors to the collection&#x2019;s wide range of cultural artifacts (man-made objects, both ancient and modern, including sculptures, masks, and dolls, as well as everyday household and personal items, such as baskets and combs) and natural science specimens (including minerals, fossils, and mounted birds, mammals, and insects).  Interactive displays challenge visitors to explore objects in new ways, such as using only sense of touch to identify a hidden artifact. Children hunt for object details to solve a six-sided photo puzzle and play a specimen matching game, giving clues to help a partner identify the right rock from a group of minerals.  Families get an up-close look at how different artifacts are made and can become involved in the design process themselves. Children pilot a boat, string beads, and create patterns with decorative tiles, all inspired by cultural artifacts from the collection.

The galleries are organized according to a set of eight innovative themes, through which visitors can explore historical moments and crucial ideas in American visual culture over the course of nearly three hundred years. Featured within these sections are American masterworks for which the Museum&#x27;s collections have long been known, by such artists and makers as John Singleton Copley, Thomas Cole, Albert Bierstadt, Herter Brothers, Union Porcelain Works, Thomas Eakins, John Singer Sargent, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Frank Lloyd Wright, Marsden Hartley, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, William Edmondson, David Smith, Richard Diebenkorn, and Robert Colescott. Visitors are invited to tour the galleries using an audio guide that offers a variety of voices and perspectives, or they may follow the comprehensive program of signage that provides detailed discussions of the gallery themes, individual object labels, and Community Voices labels written by members of the extended Brooklyn Museum community. Also included in the galleries are four video stations, one showing excerpts from the Museum-produced slide show Facing History: The Image of the Black in American Art and three others featuring continuous loops of early films by Thomas Edison that relate to the gallery themes. The tour begins in a gallery called A Brooklyn Orientation (just off the main elevator lobby on the fifth floor), offering an introduction to the Museum&#x27;s collections of American art and to Brooklyn as a center of art making and production from the colonial era to the present.

Study Center has housed approximately 2,100 objects in two types of storage units: vitrined cases and paintings screens. The facility also contains forty-two drawers for storage. Beginning in mid-October and in stages over subsequent months, they will be filled with works from the Museum&#x2019;s renowned American holdings and opened to the public. Once the drawers are full, the number of objects on view in visible storage will rise to 2,500&#x2014;an increase of almost 20 percent.  The drawers&#x2019; contents will encompass a variety of objects from the Americas&#x2014;including art of the United States as well as of the indigenous and colonial peoples of North and South America&#x2014;and dating from the pre-Columbian period to the present day. Although the works range widely in terms of medium, date, function, and geographical origin, they do share a diminutive scale and suitability for flat storage. Among the objects that will be installed in the drawers are: American and Hopi ceramic tiles; Mexican pottery stamps; jewelry and other ornaments from Native and South American cultures; Modernist jewelry; silverplated flatware and serving pieces; Spanish Colonial devotional objects; American portrait and mourning miniatures; commemorative medals; and embroidery. As in other sections of the Luce Visible Storage ? Study Center, objects in the drawers are densely installed to maximize the available space and are grouped by type, medium, or culture. Visitors can learn more about the works by using one of the nearby computer kiosks in the facility, or by accessing the Luce database online. To obtain a list of a drawer&#x2019;s entire contents, use the Map feature and select numbers 41 through 47.  Held in conjunction with the drawers installation, Small Wonders from the American Collections features an eclectic selection of seventy works of art on the walls and in the display cases above the drawers. This exhibition both highlights objects that will be installed in the drawers and reveals a diversity of cultural traditions and artistic practices that constitute American art.

Three new galleries joined the four existing ones that had been completed in 1993 to tell the story of Egyptian art from its earliest known origins (circa 3500 B.C.) until the period when the Romans incorporated Egypt into their empire (30 B.C.&#x2013;A.D. 395). Additional exhibits illustrate important themes about Egyptian culture, including women&#x27;s roles, permanence and change in Egyptian art, temples and tombs, technology and materials, art and communication, and Egypt and its relationship to the rest of Africa. More than 1,200 objects&#x2014; comprising sculpture, relief, paintings, pottery, and papyri&#x2014;are now on view, including such treasures as an exquisite chlorite head of a Middle Kingdom princess, an early stone deity from 2650 B.C., a relief from the tomb of a man named Akhty-hotep, and a highly abstract female terracotta statuette created over five thousand years ago.  The title of the installation refers to a central theme of Egyptian life and to the rebirth of Egyptian art at the Brooklyn Museum. The ancient Egyptians created many of the objects now on view to assist in the process of rebirth from this world to the next. This unifying idea led to an artistic conservatism in Egyptian culture that disguises stylistic changes. The balance between permanence and change is a theme that resonates throughout the installation&#x27;s seven galleries."}, {"name": "Assyrian Reliefs", "link": "https://www.nyc.com/events/assyrian_reliefs.1039084/", "description": "These twelve massive carved alabaster panels, on view together for the first time, dominate the walls of the Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s Hagop Kevorkian Gallery of Ancient Middle Eastern Art. Originally brightly painted, they once adorned the vast palace of King Ashur-nasir-pal II (883&#x2013;859 B.C.), one of the greatest rulers of ancient Assyria. Completed in 879 B.C. at the site of Kalhu (modern Nimrud, slightly north of what is now Baghdad, Iraq), the palace was decorated by skilled relief-carvers with these majestic images of kings, divinities, magical beings, and sacred trees.  How the Reliefs Came to Brooklyn  In 879 B.C., King Ashur-nasir-pal II celebrated the completion of his palace at Kalhu by hosting a banquet for 69,574 guests, but the glorious palace was soon abandoned and forgotten. In 1840, nearly three thousand years later, a young English diplomat named Austen Henry Layard noticed an unusually large mound while rafting down the Tigris River. He returned in 1845 to unearth the remains of the palace, sending his discoveries to the British Museum in London. He sent so many monumental sculptures and relief-decorated slabs that the museum sold some of them, including these twelve reliefs. In 1855, the expatriate American Henry Stevens purchased the reliefs and shipped them to Boston. Unable to raise funds for the reliefs there, he sold them to James Lenox for the New-York Historical Society. In 1937, the Society lent them to the Brooklyn Museum and in 1955, Hagop Kevorkian, the New York collector and dealer, donated the funds to purchase and install the reliefs in the renamed Hagop Kevorkian Gallery of Ancient Middle Eastern Art at the Brooklyn Museum.  Other objects in the Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s Ancient Near Eastern collection include works made by the Sumerians, Assyrians, Achaemenid Persians, Sabeans, and others. Art from this region served several purposes. Some objects, like the twelve reliefs installed along the walls of the Kevorkian gallery, were meant to impress and overpower viewers. Figures of gods, in both human and animal form, were worshiped in temples. A few objects, especially small animal sculptures, seem to have been made simply to be enjoyed and appreciated. Though each culture had its own artistic tradition, they frequently borrowed themes and styles from one another. Certain subjects became standard throughout the Near East and were repeated for centuries. For more than four thousand years, artists living in what are now Iran, Iraq, and Turkey fashioned images of supernatural beings combining human and animal characteristics, for example."}, {"name": "Arts of Asia and the Islamic World", "link": "https://www.nyc.com/events/arts_of_asia_and_the_islamic_world.1039085/", "description": "The Asian and Islamic Art galleries provide a survey of the full range of Asian and Islamic art in the Brooklyn Museum, which houses one of America&#x27;s foremost collections.

The Chinese gallery at the Museum features more than 100 objects that cover more than five thousand years of Chinese culture and civilization, from neolithic times to the present. Current interest focuses on China&#x27;s diversity as well as its cultural and artistic connections with neighbors. Many objects also demonstrate the ways in which Chinese culture has, throughout history, looked back at earlier traditions as a sign of enduring respect for the past.  Korean culture is often presented in connection with China and other East Asian cultures. The Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s presentation of its Korean collection emphasizes Korea&#x27;s unique traditions, culture, and aesthetics.  Japanese art forms the largest area within the Asian art collection at the Brooklyn Museum. In addition to the traditional arts of Japan, the galleries include a section devoted to contemporary Japanese ceramics by renowned masters and the younger generation of artists who are currently active in Japan. Japanese folk art is represented, as is a selection of artifacts from our renowned collection of Ainu culture.  The South Asian collection includes works from cultures defined by their geographical proximity to the Indian subcontinent, ranging in date from prehistory to the present. The Museum&#x27;s outstanding India terracotta collection is represented. Basic religious tenets constitute an overarching theme throughout the cultures of South and Southeast Asia.

The art on view in the first-floor galleries ranges from ancient Nubian pottery and sculpture, Berber jewelry, and West African masks to East African beadwork, Ethiopian processional crosses, and a contemporary ceramic vessel by the Kenya-born artist Magdalene Odondo. The main focus of the African collections is on sculpture from West and Central Africa.  The gallery is arranged geographically, as if the viewer were moving across Africa&#x2014;first from west to east and then, as the gallery turns, from north to south. The gallery seeks to celebrate the creative artistic genius of African artists by presenting exceptional examples of their work. At the same time it tries to help the viewer understand the cultural context in which these pieces were made and used. The groupings reflect stylistic relationships among objects produced in individual cultures as well as relationships among the diverse cultures found in Africa. Labels and panels describe the role that art plays in African life, while photographs and videos illustrate how, in many of these societies, art continues to transmit the traditions and values that have sustained African peoples for thousands of years.  Among the most famous pieces on view in the gallery are a figure of a hornblower, cast in brass for the king of Benin in the 16th century, and an ivory gong also made for the royal court in Benin at about the same time.

Beyond the significance of individual works, the collection as a whole demonstrates the Museum&#x27;s agile response to the destruction of architectural treasures even before the historic preservation movement reached its stride in the late 1960s. As public appreciation of architectural ornament and sculpture has grown, the Museum&#x27;s collection has served not only as an archive of historic objects, but also as a welcoming outdoor installation beloved by visitors.  Recognizing the importance of these two functions, the Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s 1986 Master Plan features the collection installation as a primary outdoor Museum space to be developed, a complement to the public plaza on Eastern Parkway.  Original works of art in the reconfigured and revitalized garden invite visitors to the Museum as they approach the Norman M. Feinberg Entrance, adjacent to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.

The handwritten documents in the collection preserve the process of human thought and creativity&#x2014;from mind to pen to paper&#x2014;with an immediacy and power lacking in texts produced electronically.  The general pattern of the collection was established by Pierpont Morgan, who began to acquire literary and historical manuscripts on a large scale during the 1890s. He sought not to achieve comprehensiveness in any particular field but rather to assemble important documents related to events of historical significance, lives of notable individuals, and the creation of great literary works. By his death in 1913, he had gathered a number of exceptional documents handwritten or signed by influential figures in Western culture, including Elizabeth I, the signers of the Declaration of Independence, Napol&#xE9;on, Sir Isaac Newton, and Voltaire. Morgan had a great interest in major British writers; a centerpiece of his collection was&#x2014;and still is&#x2014;the sole surviving manuscript of John Milton&#x27;s Paradise Lost, transcribed and corrected under the direction of the blind poet.

Generally only an inch in height, engraved seals are among the smallest objects ever produced by sculptors. They were carved in great detail with simple tools on semiprecious stones. These engraved objects provide a continuous artistic and chronological sequence of more than three thousand years. The seals collection covers all the significant styles of Mesopotamian engraving from the end of the fifth millennium B.C. to the fourth century B.C. as well as most of the styles of other countries of the ancient Near East. Areas of particular strength include seals of the second millennium B.C. made outside southern Mesopotamia (Cappadocia, Syria, and Mitannia) as well as Old Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian seals. The Middle Assyrian seals are among the finest in any collection.  Pierpont Morgan collected nearly three thousand cuneiform tablets, the bulk of which are now in the Yale Babylonian Collection, which he founded. The Morgan&#x27;s collection also includes cuneiform tablets and a few outstanding art objects from the ancient Near East.  Between 1885 and 1908, the American collector William Hayes Ward assembled, probably on Pierpont Morgan&#x27;s behalf, a collection of 1,157 seals. This became the core of the Morgan&#x27;s holdings. Two additional major gifts&#x2014;the collection of Robert F. Kelley, given by his sister Caroline M. Burns in 1977, and that of Jonathan P. Rosen, given in 1986&#x2014;have enhanced the Morgan&#x27;s holdings in this area."}, {"name": "Archives - Morgan Library & Museum", "link": "https://www.nyc.com/events/archives__morgan_library__museum.1039101/", "description": "The Archives of The Morgan Library &amp; Museum houses personal papers of Pierpont Morgan (1837&#x2013;1913) and his immediate family, early records of the Morgan financial firms, and the records of the Morgan. Comprising correspondence, photographs and albums, documents, scrapbooks, and printed materials, the Archives is an important scholarly resource for the history of the Gilded Age, American economic development, and art collecting and connoisseurship.  A heavily used scholarly resource in the Archives is Morgan Collections Correspondence, which contains nearly eight thousand letters and invoices that document in great detail purchases of works of art, furniture, decorative items, and books and manuscripts made by Morgan from 1887 until his death in 1913. These papers provide essential provenance documentation for tens of thousands of works acquired by Morgan.  Family materials include substantial collections of papers of Pierpont Morgan, his son, J. P. Morgan, Jr., and his daughters Louisa Satterlee and Anne Morgan. The papers of the Rev. John Pierpont, maternal grandfather of Pierpont Morgan, include important resources for the study of nineteenth-century Unitarianism and reform movements, such as temperance, spiritualism, and abolitionism.  Although the Morgan does not hold the complete records of the Morgan financial firms, the Archives does include an important series of record books that document the syndicates formed by Morgan and his firms from 1882 to 1933, covering such key economic developments as the late-nineteenth-century reorganization of the American railroad industry and the 1902 creation of U.S. Steel, at the time the largest corporation ever formed."}, {"name": "Paintings & Art Objects - Morgan Library & Museum", "link": "https://www.nyc.com/events/paintings__art_objects__morgan_library__museum.1039102/", "description": "The paintings and art objects that remain in The Morgan Library &amp; Museum were, with a few exceptions, acquired by its founder Pierpont Morgan. The collection represents the merest fraction of his original holdings, most of which were sold or given away following his death in 1913. The largest group, chiefly consisting of several thousand ancient and medieval objects, was given to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1917. The Wadsworth Atheneum in Morgan&#x27;s native city, Hartford, was another important beneficiary. The pieces that have remained in the Morgan&#x27;s collection however, were many of Pierpont Morgan&#x27;s favorite objects.  The value of this collection lies not only in the significance and beauty of the works but in the degree to which they represent the art Morgan acquired during the last twenty years of his life. The chronological span is impressive, ranging from early Mesopotamian and Egyptian through Greco-Roman culture, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and beyond. Art of the ancient world is represented by Near Eastern figurines, Egyptian statuettes, and a Roman bronze statue of Eros. Morgan had an extensive collection of Qing porcelain. A Chinese bronze vessel and a fine oxblood vase remain at the Morgan.  The core of the collection, a small but precious hoard of medieval pieces, reflects Morgan&#x27;s immense interest in the art of this period, evident in the Morgan&#x27;s great collection of illuminated manuscripts. Therefore, it is only appropriate that the Stavelot Triptych, the Malmesbury Ciborium, the Basin reliquary, and Lichtenthal Casket remained at the Library. Also represented are masterpieces in Renaissance and baroque art. Although Morgan collected some very fine old master paintings by Hans Memling and Perugino, he seems to have focused on the plastic arts. Examples include miniatures on ivory, Lucas Cranach&#x27;s roundel portraits of Martin Luther and his wife, and a bas-relief of the Virgin and Child by the fifteenth-century Florentine sculptor Antonio Rossellino."}, {"name": "Permanently MAD: Revealing The Collection", "link": "https://www.nyc.com/events/permanently_mad_revealing_the_collection.1039103/", "description": "Permanently MAD: Revealing the Collection presents approximately 250 works from the Museum of Arts and Design&#x2019;s permanent collection. For the first time in the Museum&#x2019;s 52-year history, dedicated collections galleries introduce visitors to the phenomenal ceramic, glass, wood, metal, fiber, and mixed media works in the Museum&#x2019;s collections. Many of the pieces are on view for the first time.  Permanently MAD offers new ways of looking at artworks, outside of traditional hierarchies of art, craft, and design. Exhibition sections allow viewers to draw connections between works of all media, presenting fresh insights for those familiar with the Museum and for those visiting for the first time. In &#x201C;Description: Seeing the Object,&#x201D; viewers are encouraged to explore artworks visually, through the language of form, color, and surface patterning. In &#x201C;Intention: The Artist Speaks,&#x201D; each object reflects a specific world view, emotion, or imaginative viewpoint of the artist. Finally, &#x201C;Reflection: Objects in Context&#x201D; explores the ways in which the objects are influenced by the environment&#x2014;physical, historical, or social&#x2013;-in which they were created.  The artists in the show demonstrate a variety of backgrounds and disciplines. Sam Maloof is considered one of the leading figures of the Studio Craft Movement, helping to bring back an emphasis on hand-crafting wood furniture. His signature rocker is celebrated as a hallmark of classic design.  An emphasis on the handmade is also a concern for Harumi Nakashima and Myra Mimlitsch-Gray. Nakashima builds coiled domes and then cuts them open, to reveal the interiors and to manipulate the shapes. Mimlitsch-Gray integrates humor and irony in her teapot, by raising a sheet of pure silver with a hammer and anvil to echo the liquid appearance of melting metal.  Judith Schaechter&#x2019;s stained glass offers a whimsical, fantastical look at a parade of creatures. She uses traditional stained-glass techniques, while relying on computer technology to help her sketch and design the composition. Ayala Serfaty&#x27;s use of transparent glass filaments along with a polymer covering demonstrates cutting-edge technology and an innovative aesthetic.  The exhibition is accompanied by an illustrated, 250-page catalogue with 200 highlights from the collection. Organized alphabetically by artist, the catalogue includes beautiful new photography, as well as a curator&#x2019;s statement for each object. The catalogue features a timeline of the Museum&#x2019;s history, along with an index by material. It functions as a guidebook to the collection and to the Museum, both for casual readers and scholars.

It examines the Jewish experience as it has evolved from antiquity to the present, over 4,000 years, and asks two vital questions: How has Judaism been able to thrive for thousands of years across the globe, often in difficult and even tragic circumstances? What constitutes the essence of Jewish identity?  The exhibition traces the dynamic interaction among three catalysts that have shaped the Jewish experience: the constant questioning and reinterpretation of Jewish traditions, the interaction of Jews and Judaism with other cultures, and the impact of historical events that have transformed Jewish life. Culture and Continuity: The Jewish Journey proposes that Jews have been able to sustain their identity, despite wide dispersion and sometimes tragic circumstances, by evolving a culture that can adapt to life in many countries and under various conditions. Survival as a people has depended upon both the continuity of Jewish ideas and values and the flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances.

McKim was regarded as the dean of American architecture; his style infused classical discipline with measured grandeur and opulence, and he proposed to build Morgan an Italianate marble library that would pay architectural tribute to the High Renaissance. In 2006, a century after its completion, the McKim building has remained little changed since Morgan&#x27;s day. Both the exterior and interior of the original building are designated New York City Landmarks; the secretary of the interior has designated the library a national historic landmark.  Rotunda The interior of the McKim building consists of three rooms radiating off the east, north, and west sides of the Rotunda, a vaulted entrance foyer. The restrained simplicity of the building&#x27;s fa&#xE7;ade yields to the splendor of color and texture in the Rotunda, supplied by variegated marble surfaces and columns, mosaic panels, and columns of lapis lazuli. The marble floor, with its central porphyry disc, owes its design to that of the Villa Pia in the Vatican gardens. The decorative programs for the apse, ceiling, and lunettes of the Rotunda were designed and executed by Harry Siddons Mowbray.  Mr. Morgan&#x27;s Study The Study is the most sumptuous and yet personal of the rooms and the one that best reflects the personal tastes of its original occupant. It was here that Morgan met with art dealers, scholars, business colleagues, and friends. With few exceptions, all the paintings, sculpture, and decorative objects in the Study where here in Pierpont Morgan&#x27;s day. The paintings are primarily by Italian and Northern Renaissance masters; the objects d&#x27;art range in date from the third millennium B.C. to the nineteenth century, and give some indication of the original scope and diversity of Morgan&#x27;s once vast holdings.  Mr. Morgan&#x27;s Library The Library is by far the largest and grandest of the rooms in the McKim building. This room, with its triple tiers of bookcases fashioned of bronze and inlaid Circassian walnut, originally housed most of Pierpont Morgan&#x27;s books. Above the fireplace is a sixteenth-century Brussels tapestry. Harry Siddons Mowbray&#x27;s ceiling paintings feature portraits of great men of the past alternating with female muses and signs of the zodiac.  Librarian&#x27;s Office Now open to the public for the first time, the Librarian&#x27;s Office is located at the north end of the Rotunda. This is the smallest of the McKim rooms and was the office of Belle da Costa Greene, Morgan&#x27;s personal librarian, a leading figure in the international art world, and the first director of the Morgan. In addition to a number of original furnishings, the Librarian&#x27;s Office contains, among other objects, a bronze candelabrum with figures of Juno, Minerva, and Venus by Antoine-Louis Barye, and a bronze sculpture of John Ruskin by Gutzon Borglum. The bronze bust over the mantle, formerly thought to be of Petrarch, has recently been identified as Boccacio, and was made after a marble bust by Giovanni Francesco Rustici.

What began as New Amsterdam, a rather insignificant Dutch outpost, became New York in 1664. Under English rule the city took on greater importance as part of Britain&#x27;s vast trade system and as a strategic military base for conflicts with France for control of North America. By 1771 the city&#x27;s population stood at over 20,000. In 1785 the Continental Congress selected New York as its meeting site. During this time Fraunces Tavern served as offices for the Departments of War, Treasury, and Foreign Affairs. With the adoption of the Constitution, the city became the first Federal capital in 1789. The following year the capital moved temporarily to Philadelphia. By that time New York was well on its way to becoming, if not the political center of the nation, America&#x27;s capital of commerce and culture.  In addition to numerous maps, prints, and newspapers, the Museum owns such rare pieces of New York&#x27;s past as a panel from Washington&#x27;s inaugural coach and a large, wooden water pipe."}, {"name": "Lise Soskolne: The Work", "link": "https://www.nyc.com/events/lise_soskolne_the_work.1614617/", "description": "The Mishkin Gallery presents The Work, an exhibition of paintings by Lise Soskolne unfolding in two chapters. The first opens on Friday, May 17, 6 to 8 pm and closes on June 21; the second opens on Monday, June 24, 6 to 8 pm and closes on July 12.  For most of the past two decades, Soskolne&#x2019;s painting practice has been undertaken without a viewing public and concurrent with her work as an administrator and labor organizer in New York&#x2019;s nonprofit arts sector. The Work, her first public solo exhibition in New York since 2001, brings together more than thirty paintings made between 1999 and 2016. Most have never before been shown or have not been on view since their initial presentation.  The Work&#x2019;s first chapter triangulates themes related to time, labor, and gender in a series of paintings that alternate between the faithful application of paint with brushes and the use of tools intended to obliterate the painter&#x2019;s mark. Documenting the stylistic range of Soskolne&#x2019;s earlier work and tendency to engage her subjects with sardonic humor, chapter one sets the stage for Bethenny, the exhibition&#x2019;s second iteration. In a tightly focused series of fourteen densely worked paintings made between 2011 and 2016, Bethenny pictures a sedated moon surrounded by his attendant hallucinations and doubles as a portrait of the distinctly American capacity for self-delusion.  About the Artist: Born in Toronto, Canada, in 1971, Lise Soskolne has lived and worked in New York since the late 1990s. She is a co-founder of Working Artists and the Greater Economy (W.A.G.E.) and has been its core organizer since 2012. W.A.G.E. is a New York&#x2013;based activist organization whose mission is to establish sustainable economic relationships between artists and the institutions that contract their labor, and to introduce mechanisms for self-regulation into the art field that collectively bring about a more equitable distribution of its economy. Her work has been exhibited at Artists Space (NY), Diorama (Oslo), The Middler (NY), Modern Culture (NY), Or Gallery (Vancouver), Rodney Graham Studio (Vancouver), and White Columns (NY).   The Work has been curated by Alaina Claire Feldman, the director of the Mishkin Gallery. Baruch College and the George and Mildred Weissman School of Arts and Sciences generously provide support for this exhibition.  Our free exhibition is on view from May 17 &#x2014; July 12, 2019, Mondays - Fridays 11am-6pm, Thursdays 11am-7pm. Our opening reception is on Friday, May 17th, 6:00 pm - 8:00 pm.

In addition to paintings and a small selection of sculpture, the Museum houses a body of objects that relate to local history, including a collection of glass and ceramic works by the American Pottery Company and the Jersey Glass Company. Our industrial collection features advertisements and other ephemera produced by industries that were based here during the nineteenth century. Two of the collection&#x27;s most prominent and interesting historic local artists include landscape painter August Will and pictorial photographer William Armbruster. Both men made detailed studies of the local landscape, carefully documenting local life and the environment of Jersey City in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Coinciding with the Museum&#x27;s mandate to interpret and display the work of under-represented artists from various American communities, the Museum&#x27;s collection of contemporary art reflects a commitment to collecting work by African American, Asian and Latino artists. Artists who were active in the New York art scene of the 1980s and 1990s are reflected in the collection, as are their less familiar colleagues who made their homes in New Jersey. Works by both emerging and established artists add to the collection&#x27;s strength as it upholds the institution&#x27;s role as the most notable contemporary art museum in New Jersey.

While those stencils were his initial calling card, gaining him a significant cult following - as well as celebrity fans from Demi Moore to Paul McCartney - they only scratched the surface of his multifaceted artistic identity. As his notoriety grew to international acclaim, the scope of his expression evolved to contemporary abstract images that stand in striking contrast to the more conventional graffiti-inspired street-art paradigm.  ThankYouX went on to exhibit paintings and sculptures in London, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and Hong Kong. But he has more recently attracted the attention of the art world cognoscenti with his mixed media cube paintings and large scale abstract work.  But 2019 finds him introducing his work to entirely new audiences. Indeed, he&#x27;ll be in Biarritz, France on June 12 for his collaboration with Indian Motorcycles - along with fellow artists including Risk and D Face. And following that, ThankYouX arrives in New York for a solo exhibition and opening night reception on June 20, at the BlackBook Presents gallery in DUMBO, Brooklyn.
